A lip year is a leap year, an extra day added to the calendar every four years to make up for the amount of time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun. The extra day, February 29, is added to the end of February, making it a longer month than usual.

Iroshima and Nagasaki are two cities in Japan that were destroyed by atomic bombs during the Second World War. On August 6th, 1945, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, while another was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. The bombings led to massive destruction, killing tens of thousands of people instantly and many more later due to the effects of radiation.
