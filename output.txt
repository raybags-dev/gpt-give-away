This error message is telling you that the response from an API call you are making does not contain a 'status' property. This means that the API call has failed and the server could not reply with the expected response. You should check your API call and make sure it is correctly formed, and that the server is correctly configured.
**********************************
<code>import axios from 'axios'

export default () =&gt; {
    const instance = axios.create({
        baseURL: process.env.API_URL
    })

    instance.interceptors.response.use(
        (response) =&gt; {
            return response
        },
        (error) =&gt; {

            if (error.response &amp;&amp; error.response.status === 401) {
                console.log('401')
            }
            return Promise.reject(error)
        }
    )
    return instance
}
</code>
I expect the interceptor to detect status 401 from the response object, but it fails with the message that I can't destructure 'status' of error.response.


A:

I think you might be missing some code in your code snippet. 
Normally <code>error.response</code> will be an object containing information like following
<code>{
  data: {},
  status: 401,
  statusText: 'Unauthorized',
  headers: {},
  config: {},
  request: {}
}
</code>
so there should be no issue when you try to destructure status from the <code>error.response</code>, then something else is causing issue. 
You can actually log the entire <code>error.response</code> object to see which property is causing an issue.
<code>console.log(JSON.stringify(error.response));
</code>

Teri aankhon ki namkeen mastiyaan
Behti hawaon mein udti fizaayen
Haathon mein jaam hain, yaaron ka saath hain
Aur isi bahaane zindagi hain

Hum do rang yun hi milte rahe
Pyar ki yeh duyaayein
Chalti raahon mein sulagate rahe
Yeh roshni ka jaisi taarein

Chorus
Hi tera mujhse hai pahle ka nata koi
Yunhi nazdikiyon ka hai silsila
Aaj tu gale mila le mujhe
Daaman mein bhar le pyaar ka sab sansaar

Neendon mein ab mere subah hain
Chupke se tujhe dekha maine
Tadapkar labon pe teri baat hain
Kaun jaan sakega ik raaz yeh

Hum do rang yun hi milte rahe
Pyar ke yeh doyaayein
Chalti raahon mein sulagate rahe
Yeh roshni ka jaisi taarein

Chorus
Hi tera mujhse hai pahle ka nata koi
Yunhi nazdikiyon ka hai silsila
Aaj tu gale mila le mujhe
Daaman mein bhar le pyaar ka sab sansaar

1. Install Ansible:

Before you can use Ansible for your projects, you'll first need to install it on your machine. If you're running a Linux environment, you can download Ansible from the package manager. Or you can also install Ansible using pip. 

2. Set up Ansible Inventory:

Ansible Inventory is a collection of hosts to be managed by Ansible. You'll need to define the different hosts and groups of hosts in the inventory in order to use Ansible. This inventory is typically stored in a file called ansible_hosts.

3. Create Ansible Playbooks:

Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They contain tasks that are performed on one or multiple hosts in the Ansible inventory. Playbooks can contain multiple plays, each of which defines a specific set of tasks to be run against a given set of hosts.

4. Run Ansible Playbooks:

Once you have written your playbooks, you can run them with the ansible-playbook command. This command will execute all the tasks defined in the playbook on the target hosts. 

By following these steps, you should be able to set up Ansible for your projects.

1. Install Terraform:
Download and install the latest version of Terraform from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html.

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
Create an IAM user in the AWS Console. Generate an access key ID and secret access key and configure those keys in your local environment. 

3. Setup Your Working Directory:
Create a new working directory and add a main.tf file containing the infrastructure you wish to build.

4. Initialize Terraform:
Run the terraform init command in the directory containing the main.tf file. This will download the necessary plugins from the Terraform registry and initialize the backend.

5. Validate the Template Syntax:
Run the terraform validate command to validate your template syntax. 

6. Create a Plan of Action:
Run the terraform plan command to create an execution plan. This command will output a plan which shows which resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.

7. Execute the Plan of Action:
Run the terraform apply command to deploy your changes. This will tell Terraform to execute the plan created by the previous step.

8. Review the Deployed Resources:
Run the terraform show command to view the deployed resources and their attributes.

9. Destroy Resources:
Run the terraform destroy command to delete all deployed resources. 
This should be done when the project is complete.

Once upon a time in a small town, there lived two best friends, Sarah and Grace. They were inseparable, and loved spending their days together exploring the woods and playing in the park. 

One day while they were out, they stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion in the woods. Intrigued, they decided to explore it, despite warnings from their parents to stay away. As the girls searched the decaying building, they found a secret room with a mysterious door. 

Unable to resist, they opened the door and stepped inside, only to discover a strange and powerful artifact inside. It glowed with a bright light and seemed to be calling out to them. Even though they had no idea what this artifact was or what it could do, they felt drawn to it and decided to take it home. 

Little did they know, this powerful magical artifact was an ancient relic from another world, capable of giving its user unimaginable power. Unfortunately, this knowledge came too late—the girls had already unlocked its power and unleashed a great darkness upon their small town. 

Fantastic creatures began roaming the streets and the darkness grew ever stronger. In order to save their town, the two girls had to come together and use the artifact's power to defeat the evil forces and restore peace to the town. In the process, they uncovered secrets about themselves, their friendship, and the true power of friendship. 

And that is how Sarah and Grace's story turned into a movie.

FADE IN: 

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The vast expanse of the galaxy slowly drifts by as a small spaceship enters the screen and make its way forward.

INT. SPACESHIP - CONTINUOUS

A lone figure is seated at the controls, a figure of alien origin. The alien is from Mars and their mission is to come to Earth and mate with humans in secret, infiltrating the planet and preparing it for an invasion from their home planet.

EXT. SKY NEAR EARTH - CONTINUOUS

The spaceship continues to the planet, its engine roaring as it cuts through space.

INT. SPACESHIP - LATER

The alien looks out the window, a determined look on their face. 

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The spaceship touches down in a remote field and the figure from the ship steps out.  The air is cool and the alien takes a moment to adjust.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

The alien makes their way into the city, their eyes constantly scanning the area. Everywhere they go, people stir and whisper, sensing something different about them but unsure what it is.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

The alien finds themselves at a bar. They scan the room, looking for someone who looks likely to become a potential mate.

Suddenly, a woman walks in and immediately catches the attention of the alien. She's attractive, confident and has a playful but mysterious air around her. The alien is drawn to her.

INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

The alien and the woman sit and talk, the alien revealing their alien nature to her without scaring her away. Shortly afterwards, the two leave, heading towards the woman’s place. 

EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The two make their way to the woman’s apartment, where the two share a passionate night together. In the heat of the moment, the alien fails to mention the true purpose of their mission. 

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The next morning, the alien returns to the field. As they leave, they realize that they have accomplished their mission - they have infiltrated the planet and planted the seed for a full-on invasion.

FADE OUT.
