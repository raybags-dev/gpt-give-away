This error message is telling you that the response from an API call you are making does not contain a 'status' property. This means that the API call has failed and the server could not reply with the expected response. You should check your API call and make sure it is correctly formed, and that the server is correctly configured.
**********************************
<code>import axios from 'axios'

export default () =&gt; {
    const instance = axios.create({
        baseURL: process.env.API_URL
    })

    instance.interceptors.response.use(
        (response) =&gt; {
            return response
        },
        (error) =&gt; {

            if (error.response &amp;&amp; error.response.status === 401) {
                console.log('401')
            }
            return Promise.reject(error)
        }
    )
    return instance
}
</code>
I expect the interceptor to detect status 401 from the response object, but it fails with the message that I can't destructure 'status' of error.response.


A:

I think you might be missing some code in your code snippet. 
Normally <code>error.response</code> will be an object containing information like following
<code>{
  data: {},
  status: 401,
  statusText: 'Unauthorized',
  headers: {},
  config: {},
  request: {}
}
</code>
so there should be no issue when you try to destructure status from the <code>error.response</code>, then something else is causing issue. 
You can actually log the entire <code>error.response</code> object to see which property is causing an issue.
<code>console.log(JSON.stringify(error.response));
</code>

This is a romantic song from the movie Aaye Din Bahar Ke (1966). The lyrics of the song are:

Teri aankhon ki namkeen mastiyaan
Behti hawaon mein udti fizaayen
Haathon mein jaam hain, yaaron ka saath hain
Aur isi bahaane zindagi hain

Hum do rang yun hi milte rahe
Pyar ki yeh duyaayein
Chalti raahon mein sulagate rahe
Yeh roshni ka jaisi taarein

Chorus
Hi tera mujhse hai pahle ka nata koi
Yunhi nazdikiyon ka hai silsila
Aaj tu gale mila le mujhe
Daaman mein bhar le pyaar ka sab sansaar

Neendon mein ab mere subah hain
Chupke se tujhe dekha maine
Tadapkar labon pe teri baat hain
Kaun jaan sakega ik raaz yeh

Hum do rang yun hi milte rahe
Pyar ke yeh doyaayein
Chalti raahon mein sulagate rahe
Yeh roshni ka jaisi taarein

Chorus
Hi tera mujhse hai pahle ka nata koi
Yunhi nazdikiyon ka hai silsila
Aaj tu gale mila le mujhe
Daaman mein bhar le pyaar ka sab sansaar

Terraforming is the process of deliberately altering a planet or other body to make it more hospitable for human life. This could include anything from introducing an atmosphere with breathable oxygen, to planting vegetation and creating bodies of water on barren planets. The idea of terraforming has been proposed as a way to make distant planets more suitable for permanent human presence.
